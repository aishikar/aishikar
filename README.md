## Hi there 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a Computer Science grad student at Arizona State University, currently focusing on software development, machine learning and big data systems. 🎓

I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that not only learn from data and make smart predictions, but also scale efficiently and integrate well into real-world applications. 🌍

I enjoy working across the stack. From designing algorithms and models to developing robust pipelines, APIs, and tools that bring those models to life. 🛠️

The projects I work on often involve solving problems with real-world impact, combining data-driven insights with solid engineering. I also like exploring areas like system design, graph analytics, and optimization when the challenge is right. 🚀

Outside of code, I’m into astronomy, photography, and occasionally pretending I’m building the next version of J.A.R.V.I.S. 🛰️✨🤣

Thanks for stopping by!
