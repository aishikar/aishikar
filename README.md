## Hi there 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a recent Master’s graduate in Computer Science from Arizona State University, with a focus on software development, machine learning, and big data systems. 🎓

I’m passionate about building scalable, high-performance systems that solve real-world problems through clean design, efficient architecture, and robust engineering. 🌍

I enjoy working across the stack. From designing core algorithms and backend logic to developing APIs, pipelines, and tools that bring ideas to life. 🛠️

The projects I work on often involve solving problems with real-world impact, combining data-driven insights with solid engineering. My work spans areas like big data processing, web development, graph analytics, backend optimization, and testing automation. 🚀

Outside of code, I’m into astronomy, photography, and occasionally pretending I’m building the next version of J.A.R.V.I.S. 🛰️✨🤣

Thanks for stopping by!
